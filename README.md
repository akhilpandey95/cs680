# cs680
A repository to store all the information useful for the course on neural networks | cs680

# About
`cs680` is a deep learning course that highlights the fundamentals of machine learning problems and how we could potentially use neural networks to approach the given problem. The course follows a "build from scratch" philosophy and uses python as the choice of programming poison.

# Structure
* `src/`: Models built and used for the experiments in the course
* `literature/`: Literature review of scientific papers useful for the course
* `data/:` Datasets used for different experiments throughout the course
* `pedagogia/:` Models built for answering the questions asked for Assignments
* `project/:` Information about the final project

# Pedagogia
* `src/assignment-1`: Understanding the fundamentals of probabilistic classifiers using Naive Bayes

# Libraries
* `numpy`
* `tensorflow`
